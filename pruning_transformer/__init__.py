"""Structured FFN-neuron and attention-head pruning for transformer models.

Import everything from here (`from pruning_transformer import X`): this
namespace is the public API, and the subpackages are its internal layout.

The package is grouped by role, and each subpackage may only depend on the
ones listed before it. `tests/test_package_layout.py` enforces that order.

    models/        how to reach into a model: adapters, layer discovery
    measurement/   running data through it: hooks, calibration, recording
    analysis/      signals from weights / firings: scores, OV math, twins
    selection/     criteria: contexts, budgets, FFN and head selectors
    surgery/       resizing modules: FFN and attention surgeons
    pipeline/      orchestration: allocation strategies, prune_* functions
