"""Attention-head redundancy analysis.

Two families of signal, both computed from weights alone:

- **Query-weight similarity / distance** -- cosine similarity or
  Lp-distance between heads' flattened query weight vectors, optionally on
  unit-normalized vectors to isolate directional (as opposed to magnitude)
  redundancy. One `normalize` switch replaces what used to be two
  nearly-identical classes (`SimilarityScanner`, `DistributionScanner`).
  This is the thesis-era signal, and a weak one: `W_Q` only decides *where*
  a head looks, so two heads with similar queries but different values do
  different jobs.
- **OV-circuit norms / similarity** -- each head's `W_O[:, h] @ W_V[h]`, the
  `(hidden, hidden)` map from what the head attends to onto what it writes
  into the residual stream. Its Frobenius norm bounds how much the head can
  change the block output at all; the cosine between two heads' OV circuits
  says whether they write the same thing. Both are what
  `head_selectors.OVNormHeadSelector` / `RedundantHeadSelector` rank by.

The OV quantities are computed through `(head_dim, head_dim)` Gram blocks
rather than by materialising every head's `(hidden, hidden)` product: for
`A_h = W_O[:, h]` and `B_h = W_V[h]`,
`<A_h B_h, A_g B_g>_F = sum((A_h^T A_g) * (B_h B_g^T))` -- `O(heads^2 *
head_dim^2)` memory instead of `O(heads * hidden^2)`.
