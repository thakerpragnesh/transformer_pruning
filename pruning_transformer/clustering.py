"""Pure K-means clustering: no autograd, no external ML dependency.

Exists as its own module because `selectors.WeightClusterRedundancySelector`
is the only consumer today, but a from-scratch k-means over normalized
weight vectors is a clustering strategy in its own right, not selector
bookkeeping -- keeping it separate is what lets the selector focus purely
on turning a cluster assignment into a `Selection`.
