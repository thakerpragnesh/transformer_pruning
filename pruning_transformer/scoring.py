"""Saliency scoring strategies.

Each strategy scores a weight tensor's output units (conv filters or
linear neurons) behind one shared interface. Any consumer (a network
scanner, a neuron selector) accepts a `SaliencyScorer` and never needs to
know which concrete scoring rule it got (Liskov substitution) or be
edited when a new one is added (Open/Closed).

Scorers here see only *one* weight tensor, so they can only express
weight-magnitude criteria. Criteria that also need the FFN's *output*
projection or calibration activations (see `calibration.py`) are
expressed as `NeuronSelector`s instead, which receive an `FFNContext` --
see `selectors.py`.

    uniform contributes a roughly constant signal regardless of the

    means the unit actually discriminates between inputs. No retraining
